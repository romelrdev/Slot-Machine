# Slot-Machine
Slot Machine project

This is a Slot Machine that users can play. You start off with $1000 and have options of different bet values. Each bet decreases from your initial value of 1000, and if you get the same image in all 3 reels, you win x10 your bet. This project helped me learn the methods Math.random and Math.floor and also properties like .length. It helped me build logic to randomize a selection from an array of images and to use that with conditoinals to create behavior that makes the user want to click to eventually win a bet.
